## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/quantitative_risk_managment.git
cd quantitative_risk_managment
```

### 2. Run with Docker

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start:
- `frontend` on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- `gateway` (API Gateway) on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- `backend` on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- `PostgreSQL` on port 5432

---

## üß† How It Works

1. The **API Gateway** (FastAPI) receives all requests from the frontend and routes them to the appropriate backend microservice (risk prediction, NVD, etc.).
2. The **Backend** (FastAPI) exposes endpoints for ML predictions (CICIDS, LANL), dynamic programming, and database operations.
3. The **ML engine** predicts the probability and severity of a risk based on input features.
4. The **DP optimizer** calculates the best mitigation strategy under constraints like budget and impact.
5. Results are visualized and stored in the database.
6. Users interact with predictions and optimizations via the React dashboard.

---

## üèõÔ∏è Design Patterns Used

- **Factory Method:** Used in `ml/engine.py` (`PredictionFactory`) to instantiate the correct prediction strategy (CICIDS, LANL) based on input.
- **Strategy:** Abstract base class `PredictionStrategy` allows interchangeable prediction logic for different models.
- **Singleton:** Each model strategy (`CICIDSPredictionStrategy`, `LANLPredictionStrategy`) is loaded only once per process, ensuring efficient resource use.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Management

- All secrets and configuration (database URL, API keys, model paths, queue settings) are managed via environment variables and `backend/app/config.py`.
- No secrets or credentials are hardcoded in the codebase.

---

## ü©∫ Observability & Health Checks

- Logging is enabled throughout the backend for model loading, errors, and queue operations.
- All prediction endpoints include error handling and log failures.
- `/health` endpoint is available for health checks.

---

## üì® Message Queue Integration

- The backend integrates a message queue (stub in `backend/app/queue.py`) for asynchronous processing (e.g., logging predictions, batch tasks).
- Ready for Azure Service Bus or a local alternative (see `QUEUE_CONNECTION_STRING` and `QUEUE_NAME` in config).
- Example: Combined prediction results are sent to the queue for async processing.

---

## üîí Security & Best Practices

- All code, comments, and documentation are in English.
- Modular, testable, and extensible backend using dependency injection and design patterns.
- No sensitive data in source code or Docker images.

---

## üåê National Vulnerability Database (NVD) API Integration

This project integrates with the [National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/) API, provided by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

> The NVD is the U.S. government repository of standards-based vulnerability management data, enabling automation of vulnerability management, security measurement, and compliance.  
> The NVD includes databases of security checklist references, software flaws, product names, and impact metrics, and enriches CVEs with additional metadata such as CVSS scores, CWE, and CPE applicability statements.

- **API Documentation:** [NVD API](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/vulnerabilities)
- **Legal Disclaimer:** The NVD is a product of the NIST Computer Security Division, Information Technology Laboratory. The NVD does not actively perform vulnerability testing, relying on vendors, third-party security researchers, and vulnerability coordinators to provide information.

## üõ£Ô∏è API Gateway Endpoints

All frontend requests are routed through the API Gateway. Main endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint                    | Description                           |
|--------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| POST   | /predict/cicids/            | Predict risk using CICIDS model       |
| POST   | /predict/lanl/              | Predict risk using LANL model         |
| POST   | /predict/combined/          | Combined risk prediction              |
| GET    | /nvd                        | Search NVD vulnerabilities            |
| POST   | /nvd/add_to_queue          | Add keyword to analysis queue         |
| POST   | /nvd/analyze_risk          | Analyze queued vulnerabilities        |
| POST   | /nvd/enterprise_metrics    | Get enterprise risk metrics           |
| GET    | /nvd/queue_status          | Get current queue status              |
| POST   | /nvd/clear_queue           | Clear analysis queue                  |
| GET    | /health                     | Health check                          |

---

## üåê API Gateway & CORS

- The API Gateway (FastAPI) is the single entry point for all frontend API calls.
- CORS is enabled to allow requests from the frontend (see `main.py` in `api_gateway`).
- Set your frontend API base URL to the gateway:
  
  ```env
  VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
  ```

---

## üß† Model Files & Configuration

- Trained model files must be present in `backend/app/ml/`:
  - `rf_cicids2017_model.pkl`
  - `isolation_forest_model.pkl`
- The backend expects these files at `/app/ml/` inside the Docker container.
- You can override the paths with environment variables `CICIDS_MODEL_PATH` and `LANL_MODEL_PATH` if needed.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables Example

```env
# .env for frontend
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080

# docker-compose.yml for backend/gateway
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/postgres
NVD_API_KEY=your-nvd-api-key
CICIDS_MODEL_PATH=/app/ml/rf_cicids2017_model.pkl
LANL_MODEL_PATH=/app/ml/isolation_forest_model.pkl
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **CORS/Preflight errors:** Ensure CORS middleware is enabled in the API Gateway (`main.py`).
- **Model file not found:** Make sure model files exist in `backend/app/ml/` and are copied into the Docker image.
- **Import errors:** Remove any local files that shadow standard library modules (e.g., `queue.py`).
- **Frontend 404 on /nvd:** Do not visit `/nvd` directly in the browser; use the app navigation.

---

## üîÑ Development & Hot Reload

- For local development, you can run each service separately and use `docker-compose` for orchestration.
- Rebuild containers after changing dependencies or model paths:
  
  ```sh
  docker-compose build
  docker-compose up -d
  ```
